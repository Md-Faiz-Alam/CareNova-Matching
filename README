## Project Overview

CareNova Patient Matching is a machine learning project designed to classify clinical studies based on their likelihood to meet specific criteria (e.g., recruitment status). The goal is to build an accurate, scalable predictive model leveraging heterogeneous data types — numeric, categorical, and free-text clinical study data — to improve clinical trial matching and recruitment efficiency.

## Features

- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline combining numeric, categorical, and textual data
- Advanced feature engineering including TF-IDF vectorization on study descriptions
- State-of-the-art gradient boosting classifier with hyperparameter tuning
- Robust handling of class imbalance via stratified splits and potential resampling
- Model evaluation with multiple metrics (Accuracy, ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- RESTful API for easy integration and real-time predictions
- Clear visualizations: ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature correlations

---

## Dataset

- Data collected from [source or repository name]
- Includes study details: enrollment numbers, study duration, phases, funding sources, textual summaries, and more
- Imbalanced target variable with ~80% positive (`study_status=1`) and ~20% negative (`study_status=0`) samples

---

## Data Preparation

- Missing values imputed (median for numeric, 'Unknown' for categorical, empty strings for text)
- Categorical features one-hot encoded with consistent columns saved for inference
- Textual fields combined and vectorized using TF-IDF (max 1000 features, English stop words removed)
- Numeric, categorical, and text features concatenated into a final feature matrix
