Primarily designed for managing type 1 diabetes, this system has demonstrated significant benefits in previous studies. Yet, despite these advantages, certain challenges persist.

Semaglutide, utilized in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, is a once-weekly injectable medication that elevates levels of a gastrointestinal hormone known as Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). This hormone alters gastric emptying, inhibits glucagon release, and reduces appetite. While not officially sanctioned for type 1 diabetes treatment in North America, studies have explored its efficacy as an adjunctive therapy alongside insulin, yielding favorable outcomes in blood glucose regulation. Comparable drugs like liraglutide and exenatide have been employed in type 1 diabetes treatment as well, albeit with less pronounced glucose-regulating effects compared to semaglutide, even in type 2 diabetes.

The number of patients with combined TB and DM now outnumbers that of combined TB and HIV and it has been estimated that 15-30% of TB disease may be attributable to diabetes globally. This may be expected to rise substantially as DM prevalence increases. Treatment of Latent TB Infection (LTBI) in this population will likely have a significant clinical benefit. Similar to HIV-infected individuals, those with DM might benefit from therapy to prevent the development of TB disease. Current international guidelines do not recommend LTBI management in people with DM, but this is because no studies have examined the risk-benefit ratio of such an intervention. To date, no RCTs have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of preventive treatment of LTBI in DM patients. Based on evidence on effectiveness, safety, and treatment completion rates, 3HP has been selected as the regimen of choice for this study of African people living with DM. People living with DM will be randomized to 3HP or placebo to determine the efficacy of 3HP in the prevention of TB disease in this population.

Physical exercise is important for diabetes control. Metformin and investigation availability have a positive association with diabetes control.

Diabetes mellitus increases the risk and accelerates the course of peripheral artery disease, making patients more susceptible to ischemic events and infections and delaying tissue healing.

The main question we aim to answer is whether a Lyumjev-pramlintide fully closed loop system improves time in range compared to a hybrid closed loop system with carbohydrate counting. We also aim to find the optimal insulin to pramlintide ratio for glycemic control in the fully automated system.

They constitute a group of patients with ""double diabetes"" since they have both true type 1 diabetes and inherited insulin resistance, typical of type 2 diabetes.

For several years, GLP1 agonists have been successfully used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, leading to very significant improvements in glycemic control and weight loss.

Because of the insulin-sensitizing power of GLP1 agonists, the investigators hypothesize that they could reduce insulin resistance in patients with ""double diabetes"" and thus improve their glycemic control.

This combination product is designed for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Upon implantation, the Cell Pouch is designed to form a natural environment, rich in tissue and microvessels for the transplant and function of therapeutic cells. The Cell Pouch is designed as a scaffold made of non-degradable polymers, formed into small cylindrical chambers which, when implanted against the abdominal muscle, becomes incorporated with vascularized tissue to the circumference of removable plugs within as early as two weeks as demonstrated in preclinical studies. After the tissue incorporation, the plugs are removed, leaving fully formed tissue chambers with central void spaces for the transplantation of therapeutic cells including Islets of Langerhans (islets). Tissue integration within and around the Cell Pouch forms a natural environment, rich in microvessels that allows the transplanted islets to engraft, resulting in a functional biohybrid organ. It is believed this engraftment will enable long-term survival and function of transplanted islets. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of islet transplantation into the Cell Pouch for the treatment of T1D in subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes.

It can lead to fatal short-term and long-term complications, especially if it is diagnosed late. Three stages of the disease can be identified: Stage 1 is defined by the presence of two or more anti-islet autoantibodies (GAD65, ICA, IA-2, ZnT8) with normoglycemia, Stage 2 shows progression to dysglycemia (impaired glucose tolerance) in the setting of two or more anti-islet autoantibodies, Stage 3 occurs when a patient meets ADA criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. It's been demonstrated that Teplizumab (an Fc receptor nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) delays the transition from pre-symptomatic T1D (stage 2) to overt T1D (stage 3). Also Sitagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, has been proved effective in inhibiting inflammation in T1D both in vitro in T1D mice, and in vivo in Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) patients. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Sitagliptin reduces the prevalence of worse forms of acute GVHD after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

The study aims to investigate if Sitagliptin can have a delaying effect on progression to overt T1D, on the account of its anti-inflammatory properties. The cohort is made of screened relatives of T1D patients, who are classified as high-risk of developing T1D.

NCT06524960,Denosumab for Type 1 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06524960,,RECRUITING,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises from abnormal immune cell-mediated injury to beta cells that make insulin. The injured beta cells can then no longer make the needed amount of insulin to stay healthy. However, in the early stages of T1D, some beta cells are still alive and functioning. Treatment to protect the beta cells against injury at this time could slow the progress of disease. Denosumab is an approved treatment for osteoporosis (a disease that thins and weakens the bones), high blood calcium levels, bone cancer, and other bone problems in patients who have cancer. The research team has found that the bone pathway that denosumab works on to treat these bone conditions also has effects on the health of the beta cells. Lab studies suggest that denosumab may protect and/or increase the number of beta cells and improve how well they work.

NCT06938334,A First-in-human Clinical Trial Using a Gene Therapy With Patient's Own Stem Cells to Treat Early Type 1 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06938334,IMMUNOSTEM,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Purpose:

The purpose of the trial is to assess the safety profile of the study treatment and to evaluate its efficacy in terms of improvement in key diabetes management parameters, including insulin requirements and β-cell function, and immunological parameters, in patients with T1D at recent onset / diagnosis and with residual β-cell function.

Rationale:

The study treatment consists of an autologous CD34+-enriched population that contains HSPCs transduced ex vivo with a third generation VSV-G pseudotyped LVV encoding the hPD-L1 cDNA. The drug product (DP) is composed of genetically modified autologous CD34+ HSPCs formulated in cryopreservation medium, transferred to the final container closure, and cryopreserved.

The mechanism of action is based on the ability of the PD-L1-expressing HSPCs to exert immunoregulatory properties activity and ablate suppress the autoimmune reaction induced by auto-reactive T lymphocytes, by homing to the site of inflammation, i.e., the pancreas.

PD-L1 is the ligand for the PD-1 receptor, expressed primarily on activated T cells. Crosslinking of PD-L1 and PD-1 inhibits T cell activation and favours their exhaustion/apoptosis and in mice deficient in PD-L1/PD-1 develop accelerated diabetes. HSPCs have been extensively used as an effective therapeutic approach in haematological malignancies and have demonstrated to be safe in human subjects.

Immunologically based clinical trials performed thus far have failed to cure T1D, in part because these approaches were nonspecific. Because the disease is driven by autoreactive CD4+ T cells, which destroy β cells, transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has been recently offered as a therapy for T1D. Our transcriptomic profiling of HSPCs revealed that these cells are deficient in PD-L1, an important immune checkpoint, in the T1D non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Notably, the immunoregulatory molecule PD-L1 plays a determinant role in controlling/inhibiting activated T cells and thus maintains immune tolerance. Furthermore, our genome-wide and bioinformatic analysis revealed the existence of a network of microRNAs (miRNAs) controlling PD-L1 expression, and silencing one of key altered miRNAs restored PD-L1 expression in HSPCs. The Investigators therefore sought to determine whether restoration of this defect would cure T1D as an alternative to immunosuppression. Genetically engineered or pharmacologically modulated HSPCs overexpressing PD-L1 inhibited the autoimmune response in vitro, reverted diabetes in newly hyperglycemic NOD mice in vivo, and homed to the pancreas of hyperglycemic NOD mice. The PD-L1 expression defect was confirmed in human HSPCs in T1D patients as well, and pharmacologically modulated human HSPCs also inhibited the autoimmune response in vitro.

The Investigators therefore hypothesized that targeting a specific immune checkpoint defect in HSPCs thus may contribute to establishing a cure for T1D or slow the progression of β-cell destruction.",NO,"Diabetes, Type I",GENETIC: Autologous CD34+ cell enriched population containing HSPCs transduced ex vivo using a LVV encoding the hPD-L1 DNA,"Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, For each participant, number, description and grading of any adverse event, including expected and unexpected adverse events, meeting or not meeting the definition of ""serious""., Up to 24 months","Vector Copy Number, Longitudinal analysis of vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood samples to assess frequency and persistence of infused cells and their progenies, Up to 24 months|Safety and efficacy, Changes over time of the 3-hour area under curve (AUC) and ΔAUC normalised by baseline glucose blood levels of C-peptide response to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) over 12 and 24 months, on month 12 and 24 month|Safety and efficacy, Changes over time of glucose metrics from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over 12 and 24 months, on month 12 and 24 month|Safety and efficacy, Exogenous insulin requirement defined as a daily average in units per kilogram per day (U/kg/day) during the previous 14 days, Up to 24 months|Pharmacodynamic, Longitudinal analysis of vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood samples to assess frequency and persistence of infused cells and their progenies, from Treatment to end of study|Safety and efficacy, Changes over time of HbA1c levels over 12 and 24 months, on month 12 and 24 month|Safety and efficacy, Number of self-reported episodes of severe (CTCAE version 5.0 grade 3) hypoglycaemia, Up to 24 months",,Altheia Science,Evidenze Health S.r.l.,ALL,ADULT,PHASE1|PHASE2,15,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IMMUNOSTEM|2025-521304-21-00,2025-08-15,2029-06-15,2029-06-15,2025-04-22,,2025-04-22,"Azienda Ospedale-Università Padova, Padova, Italia, Italy",

Under the background of the increasing number of liver cirrhosis patients with metabolic abnormalities, how to optimize treatment is particularly important. The traditional treatment of diabetes at the stage of liver cirrhosis is limited to insulin intensive therapy, but the incidence of hypoglycemia is high, blood sugar fluctuates greatly, and multiple injections are required. Research shows that insulin therapy has an increased overall mortality compared with non insulin therapy. We used metformin,Ryzodeg and an oral DDP IV enzyme inhibitor as the core combination according to the special pathological mechanism of elevated blood glucose in liver cirrhosis . After preliminary experiments, we found that the program was stable and was not easy to have hypoglycemia, and there was no traditional risk of lactic acid poisoning caused by metformin. We designed an open randomized controlled clinical study, Compared with the traditional insulin intensive treatment scheme, this new combination scheme was compared whether it could improve the blood glucose level, the incidence of hypoglycemia and lactic acid level, the incidence of cirrhosis complications, and the long-term survival rate of liver disease.

Several recent clinical trials point to the need for an approach that produces comprehensive immune modulation at both the local pancreatic and systemic levels. Stem Cell Educator (SCE) therapy offers comprehensive immune modulation at both the local and systemic levels in T1D by using a patient's own immune cells (including platelets) that are ""educated"" by cord blood stem cells. Tested clinically in more than 200 patients, SCE therapy has shown lasting reversal in autoimmunity in T1D patients, including improved C-peptide levels, reduced median glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) values, and decreased median daily usage of insulin.

PROMIS-29 is scored using T-scores. Higher T-scores indicate a higher level of the underlying construct.

Each domain has a set of questions, typically 4 to 6 items, and responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., ""Never,"" ""Rarely,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""Often,"" ""Always"" or ""Not at all,"" ""A little bit,"" ""Somewhat,"" etc.). The responses are then scored on a T-score scale (with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general population).

T-scores Interpretation:

* A T-score of 50 is the average score for the general population.
* T-scores above 50 indicate better functioning or less severe symptoms.
* T-scores below 50 indicate worse functioning or more severe symptoms., Baseline to 24 weeks|Insulin sensitivity, Change in sensitivity from baseline vs 24 weeks (Homeostatic Model Assessment, Matsuda Index), Baseline to 24 weeks|Beta cell function, Change in Beta cell function from baseline vs 24 weeks using oral disposition index, Baseline to 24 weeks","Ketosis, Percentage of participants experiencing Ketosis based on meter data, Baseline to 24 weeks|Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) events, Number of DKA events, Baseline to 24 weeks|Insulin needs, Percentage of participants experiencing requirement for insulin, Baseline to 24 weeks|Chronic pancreatitis exacerbation, Percentage of participants experiencing CP exacerbation, Baseline to 24 weeks|Acute pancreatitis episodes, Percentage of participants experiencing AP episodes, Baseline to 24 weeks|Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, Percentage of participants experiencing incident exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, Baseline to 24 weeks|Vitamin D, Decrease in vitamin D, Baseline to 24 weeks|Bone fractures, Percentage of participants experiencing bone fractures, Baseline to 24 weeks|Adverse events, Adverse events: Anemia, edema, urinary tract infection, Vaginal yeast infection, Baseline to 24 weeks",Mayo Clinic,University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,40,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,24-003868,2025-05-01,2027-05-31,2027-05-31,2024-12-12,,2025-04-11,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, United States|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15219, United States",
NCT05762107,A Study of the Effect of ZT-01 on Night-time Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05762107,ZONE,RECRUITING,"The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effect of the study drug (ZT-01) on low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who have been having low blood sugars (""hypos"") at night. ZT-01 increases the amount of a hormone called glucagon during low blood sugar, and this may help prevent the occurrence of hypos. The main questions this trial aims to answer are whether ZT-01 lowers the number of hypos happening at night, and what its effects are on blood sugar levels. The safety of ZT-01 will also be measured.

Participants will be asked to wear a study-provided continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during two 4-week periods when they will self-inject the study drug before bed. They will get ZT-01 at one of three dose levels during one period, and placebo (which looks like the study drug but doesn't contain the active ingredient) during the other. Neither the participant nor the study site will know what they are receiving during each treatment period or see data from the CGM. The participant will continue to use their usual methods of measuring blood sugar (including their personal CGM) and giving insulin during the study. The participant will be asked to complete a short diary each evening, and will be asked to upload the CGM data to a study phone every day.

If a participant uses their own CGM and is willing to share information on how often they have low blood sugar with the study site at the first visit to see if they meet study entry requirements, they will have 6 study visits, 2 study phone calls, and be in the study for about 16 weeks. If they don't use CGM or don't want to share their information, then they will be asked to wear a study CGM for an extra 4 weeks to find out how many low blood sugars they have, and will have an extra visit.

Study participants will be asked to give blood and urine for testing to see whether they meet the requirements to enter the study, and at the start and end of each treatment period to see if the study treatment has any effects. They will also have their blood pressure and temperature taken at each study visit, and have an ECG at 4 visits to measure the electrical activity of their heart.

Some participants will be asked to also take part in a sub-study where their blood level of ZT-01 and glucagon is measured, after the first and last dose. They will be asked to stay at the study site overnight for each set of measurements (4 in total).",NO,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus With Hypoglycemia,"DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: ZT-01, 7 mg|DRUG: ZT-01, 15 mg|DRUG: ZT-01, 22 mg","Incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia, Rate of nocturnal (midnight to 06:00 AM) hypoglycemic events (glucose \<54 mg/dL) lasting at least 15 minutes, compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period","Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Number of patients experiencing AEs compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period and 2-week followup|Glucose time below range, Glucose time below 54 mg/dL (as %) compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period|Incidence of hypoglycemia, Number of hypoglycemic events (glucose \<70 mg/dL for at least 15 minutes, compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period","Glucose time in range, Glucose time in range (70-180 mg/dL, %) compared to placebo, During each 28-day treatment period|Mean glycemic variability, Percent coefficient of variation of glucose values compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period|Mean glucose concentration, Mean glucose concentration compared to placebo, During each 28 day treatment period",Zucara Therapeutics Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,186,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION",ZT01-CL-2001,2023-07-28,2025-06,2025-07,2023-03-09,,2025-03-11,"Headlands Research, Escondido, California, 92025, United States|USC Keck Medicine Eastside Center for Diabetes, Los Angeles, California, 90022, United States|LCGK Research, San Carlos, California, 94070, United States|East Coast Institute for Research LLC, Jacksonville, Florida, 32216, United States|Suncoast Clinical Research, New Port Richey, Florida, 34652, United States|Hanson Diabetes Center, Port Charlotte, Florida, 33952, United States|Metabolic Research Institute, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33401, United States|East Coast Institute for Research, Macon, Georgia, 31210, United States|IU Health University Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|MedStar Good Samaritan Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, 21239, United States|Palm Research Center, Inc., Las Vegas, Nevada, 89148, United States|Albany Medical Center, Albany, New York, 12203, United States|Lucas Research Inc., Morehead City, North Carolina, 28557, United States|University Diabetes & Endocrine Consultants, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37411, United States|Texas Diabetes & Endocrinology, PA, Austin, Texas, 78749, United States|Southern Endocrinology Associates, Mesquite, Texas, 75149, United States|Diabetes & Glandular Disease Clinic, San Antonio, Texas, 78229, United States|Centricity Research Calgary Endocrinology, Calgary, Alberta, T2H 2G4, Canada|BC Diabetes, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Y 3W2, Canada|Centricity Research Barrie Endocrinology, Barrie, Ontario, L4N 7L3, Canada|Centricity Research Vaughan Endocrinology, Concord, Ontario, L4K 4M2, Canada|Centricity Research Etobicoke Endocrinology, Etobicoke, Ontario, M9R 4E1, Canada|Centricity Research Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M4G 3E8, Canada|Mount Sinai Hospital: Leadership Sinai Centre for Diabetes, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 3L9, Canada",

The results of this trial will help in improving the health and treatment results of the type 2 diabetic patients.

The main question the trial aims to answer is whether there is a difference in blood-sugar and blood circulatory system treatment results between voglibose + metformin and glibenclamide + metformin treatment combinations.

Participants that agree to participate in the trial will be asked to provide a sample of blood so that the following measurable laboratory factors will be used to compare any differences in treatment results between the two treatment groups from the beginning to the end of the trial:

* Total Cholesterol (TC),
* Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL-c),
* High Density Lipoproteins (HDL-c),
* Fasting Triglycerides (FTG),

The STAI has two sub-scales, the State-Anxiety Scale (STAI-S; 20 items) and the Trait-Anxiety Scale (STAI-T; 20 items). The STAI-S evaluates the current state of anxiety, asking how respondents feel ""right now,"" using items that measure subjective feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, worry, and activation/arousal of the autonomic nervous system. The STAI-T evaluates relatively stable aspects of ""anxiety proneness,"" including general states of calmness, confidence, and security. The total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating more pronounced anxiety. A score above 39/80 indicates clinically significant anxiety symptoms., Day 0, day 1, day 14, day 28|Change in EmBody/EmFace to assess recognition of facial and body expressions, The EmBody and EmFace subtasks comprise each of 42 stimuli showing body or facial expressions of angry, happy, or neutral affect. Stimuli last 1.5 seconds at 24 frames per second and are geometrically and optically standardised to prevent biases induced by ethnic cues. Each trial consists of one point-light display (PLD), followed by a response window during which participants are asked to indicate via mouse input which emotion they believe was portrayed in the PLD in a three-option forced-choice format (angry-neutral-happy).

The task includes ten neutral faces and 160 faces that express one of four basic emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, and fear), with pictures morphed between 0% (i.e., neutral) and 100% in 10% steps. Stimuli are shown in random order for 500 ms, followed by the rating screen, where participants have to indicate the correct emotion. The outcome measure is accuracy (proportion correct)., Day 0, day 28|Change in Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) to assess the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy, The computer-assisted test consists of 40 photographs that showed people in emotionally charged situations. To assess cognitive empathy, the participants are required to infer the mental state of the subject in each scene and indicate the correct mental state from a list of four responses. Cognitive empathy is the percentage of correct responses in the total responses. To measure emotional empathy, the subjects are asked to rate how much they feel for an individual in each scene (i.e., explicit emotional empathy) and how much they are aroused by each scene (i.e., implicit emotional empathy) on a 1-9 point scale., Day 0, day 1, day 28|Change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM) to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms, The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety).

- Generalized lipodystrophy can cause high blood fat levels and resistance to insulin. This can lead to health problems including diabetes. Researchers have found that the drug metreleptin improves health in people with this disease.

Objective:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of metreleptin.

Eligibility:

* People ages 6 months and older with generalized lipodystrophy who:
* have received metreleptin through NIH studies AND
* cannot get it through approved or compassionate use mechanisms in their home country.

Design:

* Participants will come to NIH approximately every 6 months during year one, then every 1 2 years. Financial assistance may be available for travel within the U.S.
* At visits, participants will get a supply of metreleptin to take home for daily injections. They will have:
* plastic catheter placed in an arm vein.
* blood tests, urine collection, and physical exam.
* oral glucose tolerance test, drinking a sweet liquid.
* ultrasound of the heart, liver, uterus, and ovaries. A gel and a probe are placed on the skin and pictures are taken of the organs.
* echocardiogram, which takes pictures of the heart with sound waves.
* Resting Metabolic Rate taken. A plastic hood is worn over the head while the oxygen they breathe is measured.
* Participants will have up to 3 DEXA scan x-rays per year.
* Participants may have:
* annual bone x-rays.
* liver biopsies every few years. A needle will be inserted into the liver to obtain a small piece. Participants will sign a separate consent for this.

GDM has a growing prevalence up to 5-10% (and even higher in specific subgroups), with a pregnant population becoming older and more obese worldwide. GDM increases the risks of complications during pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term, like type 2 diabetes (T2D) and persistent obesity, in mother and child. Moreover, insulin added to diet as the standard care for GDM has disadvantages for mother (maintenance of hyperinsulinaemia, increasing weight and blood pressure) and child (macrosomia, hypoglycaemia) with related adverse pregnancy outcomes. Metformin, as an insulin sensitizer targeting the cause of GDM, may have essential benefits, as suggested by observational studies. However, RCTs with metformin (early positioned in the treatment of GDM) are still lacking. The POEM study is the first Randomized controlled trial (RCT) in GDM to test the hypothesis that metformin, early given from the start of the diagnosis GDM, on top of diet and lifestyle improves clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes in mother and child during pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term - up to 20 years after birth.",NO,Gestational Diabetes|Insulin Resistance,DRUG: Metformin TEVA 850 mg,"GDM Outcome Score (GOS) in Phase A, An aggregate score of eight clinically relevant endpoints, as previously defined:

NCT04542148,Glycemic Control After Antenatal Corticosteroids in Women with Pregestational and Gestational Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04542148,,RECRUITING,"There is a fundamental gap in understanding the maternal and neonatal effects of antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration in women with threatened preterm birth (PTB) who have diabetes. Since the initial discovery of ACS for neonatal benefit in 1972, more than 40 randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating its efficacy. However, none of these trials have included women with T2DM, and there is limited data among women with gestational diabetes. While ACS have been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity associated with PTB in non-diabetic women, the side effects of ACS (maternal hyperglycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia) may mitigate the neonatal benefit of ACS in women with diabetes. Before neonatal benefit of ACS can be evaluated in this population, the first step is to optimize maternal glycemic control after ACS. Previous studies evaluating maternal hyperglycemia after ACS have been limited by small sample size, retrospective study design, or insufficient glucose data. Use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in a randomized clinical trial provides a unique opportunity to overcome these challenges. Our long-term goal is to improve maternal and child health among women with diabetes as an independently funded clinical researcher. The research objectives of this proposal are to test the efficacy of three treatment strategies at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and evaluate the association between maternal glycemic control and neonatal outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that treatment with a continuous insulin infusion will improve maternal glycemic control, which is key to improving neonatal outcomes, but at the cost of less patient satisfaction and more health resource utilization. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of three treatment strategies (addition of sliding scale insulin, up-titration of home insulin, and continuous insulin infusion) at achieving maternal glycemic control after ACS and 2) Quantify the association between maternal glycemic control after ACS and neonatal morbidity. Completion of these aims will determine the optimal strategy to achieve maternal glycemic control after ACS and inform a larger, multicenter trial to improve neonatal outcomes among women with diabetes and threatened PTB.",NO,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Preterm Birth|Pregnancy, High Risk|Diabetes, Gestational",DRUG: Sliding Scale Insulin|DRUG: Up-Titration of Home Insulin|DRUG: Continuous Insulin Infusion|DEVICE: Dexcom G6 Professional Continuous Glucose Monitor,"Time In Range, Percent time glucose in range (65-140mg/dL) on CGM, During study intervention assessed for maximum of 5 days after ACS","Time Above Range, Percent time glucose above range (\>140mg/dL) on CGM, During study intervention assessed for maximum of 5 days after ACS|Time Below Range, Percent time glucose below range (\<65mg/dL) on CGM, During study intervention assessed for maximum of 5 days after ACS|Additional insulin requirement, Percent increase in daily insulin requirements compared to home regimen, During study intervention assessed for maximum of 5 days after ACS|Glucose variability, Coefficient of variation (glucose standard deviation / mean glucose) on CGM, During study intervention assessed for maximum of 5 days after ACS|Patient satisfaction, Score on modified Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) with score range from 0-36 with 0 being not satisfied and 36 being very satisfied, Upon completion of study intervention, on average 5 days after enrollment|Neonatal composite respiratory morbidity, Composite including need for continuous positive airway pressure or high-flow nasal cannula of \>=0.30 for \>=12 continuous hours, respiratory distress syndrome, or mechanical ventilation, Birth to hospital discharge, assessed up to 28 days|Initial neonatal glucose, Initial capillary neonatal glucose in mg/dL measured by heelstick, Birth to 2 hours of life|Umbilical cord blood C-peptide, C-peptide concentration (mcg/L) in the umbilical cord blood as measure of fetal insulin status, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood insulin, Insulin concentration (mcg/L) in the umbilical cord blood as measure of fetal insulin status, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood cortisol, Cortisol concentration (mcg/L) in the umbilical cord blood as measure of fetal HPA axis, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood surfactant protein A (SP-A), Fetal surfactant protein A, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood surfactant protein B (SP-B), Fetal surfactant protein B, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood surfactant protein C (SP-C), Fetal surfactant protein C, Delivery|Umbilical cord blood surfactant protein D (SP-D), Fetal surfactant protein D, Delivery",,University of Alabama at Birmingham,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE2,120,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,300005848,2022-02-10,2025-10-31,2025-11-30,2020-09-09,,2024-10-08,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, 35223, United States|Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|University of South Carolina Greenville / Prisma Health-Upstate, Greenville, South Carolina, 29605, United States|University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, 77024, United States",

NCT06192693,Fecal Microbiota Transfer to Improve Diabetes Control Post-bariatric Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06192693,DRIFTER,RECRUITING,"Obesity progresses worldwide with few effective treatments leading to a burst in Bariatric surgery (BS). France is the 3rd country in BS numbers yearly.

BS improves diabetes (T2D) and even induces diabetes remission (DR) in 60% of patients. Thus, an expert consensus recommended extending BS to T2D with BMI≥30kg/m² with uncontrolled glycaemia, anticipating even more BS. Glycaemic control further deteriorates in the longer term in non DR (NDR) patients and relapse occurs in some DR patients, urging the need to add new therapy to control glycaemia and provide new recommendations in the future.

Obesity and T2D are characterized by gut microbiota dysbiosis with low to very low microbial gene richness (MGR). About 75% of patients' candidates for BS are in the low MGR category. Whereas BS modifies microbiota composition and increases MGR 1-year post-BS, we demonstrated that only a few patients reach high MGR. Dysbiosis can be improved by several means; fibre enriched diet, prebiotics, probiotics also improve metabolic alterations and insulin resistance in mice. However, human studies observed rather divergent results: some studies display a beneficial effect in improving insulin-resistance but to a small extent while others do not display any significant effects at all. Therefore, other innovative strategies should be tested in humans. For example, Faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) ameliorates insulin sensitivity and MGR in metabolic syndrome patients, but was never tested in T2D nor post-BS. Whether adding such an innovative therapy to further modify gut microbiota post-BS can help improve glucose control should be tested.

FMT showed health benefits in several diseases (clostridium difficile (CD) and Crohn's). Until recently, FMT was performed using invasive tool (endoscopy or colonoscopy) thus with potential secondary effects, or enema yet maybe less effective. Recent technologic developments enabled to generate oral capsulized FMT (filled with fecal material) performing as well as invasive FMT for CD with good tolerance. This strategy has never been tested in obesity or T2D, whereas in metabolic syndrome patients (before T2D occurrence) and less severe dysbiosis, a proof-of-concept study showed that endoscopic FMT may improve insulin sensitivity after 6 weeks. Yet these studies have included a small number of patients, non T2D and did not test oral FMT. We here hypothesize that an intervention improving dysbiosis after 1-year post-BS might help improve/maintain diabetes control in the long-term.

The main question this study aims to answer is:

Is a Lifestyle Intervention or Metformin more effective for weight loss in postpartum women with recent gestational diabetes?

Researchers will compare a 6-month Lifestyle Intervention and Metformin to see if either intervention is more effective in achieving weight loss and improving health outcomes.

Participants will:

* Attend an in-person baseline visit to receive a Bluetooth-enabled scale and Fitbit, have blood drawn for testing, and have their height, weight, and blood pressure measured. Participants will also be asked to bring in their infant, and the study team will measure the infant's weight and length.
* Track diet, physical activity, and weight using the Fitbit and Looseit! apps.
* Attend weekly online group sessions for the first 4 weeks, then biweekly sessions.
* If not meeting weight loss goals, be randomized to either Enhanced Lifestyle Intervention or Metformin arms of the study.
* If randomized to Metformin, participants will attend one in-person meeting with the study provider, get blood drawn for testing, and undergo a urine pregnancy test before starting the medication.
* Continue with biweekly group sessions or have regular check-in calls.
* If randomized to the Enhanced Lifestyle Intervention, participants will get a free Instacart membership, a 1:1 session with the study health counselor focused on meal planning and free grocery delivery once a week for the remainder of the study.
* Participants will meet every other week via Zoom with the health counselor and other participants in the enhanced lifestyle arm.

Stimuli last 1.5 seconds at 24 frames per second and are geometrically and optically standardized to prevent biases induced by ethnic cues (e.g., hair or skin tone) or clothing. Item order is pseudorandom to prevent sequence effects and was determined using the following constraints: the same emotion is shown no more than twice in a row; the same view per emotion is not shown consecutively (i.e., no angry-front, angry-front)., up to 4 weeks|Effect of oxytocin compared to placebo in patients with AVP deficiency compared to healthy controls cortisol in response to acute stress, Differences between the placebo and oxytocin session will be assessed for each participant in cortisol levels in response to acute psychosocial stress induced upon the TSST (Trier Social Stress Test) by 15% or more in the area under the cortisol response curve.

Salivary cortisol will be measured (as a measure of unbound cortisol concentrations in plasma) before and upon the TSST. Blood cortisol will also be measured The TSST consists of an unprepared speech and mental arithmetic performed in front of an audience.

MET is a computer-assisted test, which consists of 40 photographs that show people in emotionally charged situations. To measure emotional empathy subjects are asked to rate how much they feel for an individual in each scene and how much they are aroused by each scene on a 1-9-point scale.

The STAI has two sub-scales, the State-Anxiety Scale (20 items) and the Trait-Anxiety Scale (20 items). The State-Anxiety Scale evaluates the current state of anxiety, asking how respondents feel ""right now,"" using items that measure subjective feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, worry, and activation/arousal of the autonomic nervous system. The Trait-Anxiety Scale evaluates relatively stable aspects of ""anxiety proneness,"" including general states of calmness, confidence, and security.

NCT05169060,Omega-3 Fatty Acid Lipidomics in Diabetes Peripheral Neuropathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05169060,,RECRUITING,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common chronic complication of diabetes, affecting about 50% of patients with diabetes and leading to severe morbidity, poor quality of life, high mortality, and high health care costs. Due to the complex structure and anatomy of the peripheral nervous system, DPN presents with a very broad spectrum of clinical symptoms and deficits, including severe pain, sensory deficits, foot ulcers and amputations. Presently there is no treatment for DPN and even with good blood glucose control DPN develops especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. There is a need to identify effective interventions for DPN. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that the combination of fish oil and salsalate is an effective treatment of DPN. The human subject study to be performed will examine the effect of fish oil with and without salsalate on the blood lipid profile and circulating metabolites of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fish oil is an excellent source for the nutrition dependent omega-3 PUFA, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6). These fatty acids are the source of anti-inflammatory metabolites known as resolvin, neuroprotectin and maresin. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that the metabolites of EPA and DHA are neuroprotective. Furthermore, when fish oil is combined with salsalate the production of these metabolites is increased in vivo. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that fish oil and salsalate will be an effective therapy of DPN. However, prior to doing a formal study of the effect of fish oil + salsalate on DPN there is a need to learn more about what concentration combination will provide the most efficacious effect on the omega-3 index (defined as the sum of EPA and DHA, as a percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells) and that will safely increase the production of the anti-inflammatory metabolites. These studies will be performed at two sites the University of Iowa (Dr. Yorek) and University of Michigan (Dr. Pop-Busui) by treating human subjects with type 2 diabetes and DPN with either 2g or 4g of fish oil per day (capsules) for 4 months and then adding salsalate 1.5 g or 3g per day (tablets) to the fish oil treatments for an additional 2 months. At baseline and after treatment with fish oil alone and after treatment with the combination of fish oil and salsalate the omega-3 index and levels of circulating omega-3 PUFA metabolites will be determined as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will include determination of circulatory inflammatory markers and non-invasive measurements for DPN.

Under fasting conditions, the liver is able to make sugar to maintain glucose levels in an important process called endogenous glucose production (EGP). Previous studies suggest that the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain, helps to regulate levels of glucose in the body by communicating with the liver. This process can be impaired in people with type 2 diabetes, and can contribute to the high level of glucose seen in these individuals.

The purpose of this study is to understand how activating control centers of the brain with a medication called diazoxide can affect how much glucose (sugar) is made by the liver.

HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle unable to relax efficiently to pump the blood around the body. This leads to fluid build-up, breathlessness and inability to tolerate physical exertion. People who develop HFpEF do less well because treatment options are limited. Pilot data in patients with obesity and diabetes and a small number of patients with HFpEF have shown improvements in exercise capacity and reversal of changes in the heart and blood vessels. This study will assess if this is achievable in a multi-ethnic cohort of patients with established HFpEF. A total of 102 adults will be invited and allocate by chance into two groups: either a 12-week diet or health advice on how to lose weight.

NCT06217302,Sotagliflozin to Slow Kidney Function Decline in Persons With Type 1 Diabetes and Diabetic Kidney Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06217302,SUGARNSALT,RECRUITING,"Powerful new drugs that can prevent or delay end stage kidney disease (ESKD) - so called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) - are now available for patients with type 2 diabetes. Whether these drugs have similar effects in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown because of the few studies in this population, due to concerns about the increase in risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, a serious, potentially fatal acute complication of diabetes due to the accumulation of substances called ketone bodies) observed with SGLT2i therapy in T1D. One of the few T1D studies conducted to date showed that implementing an enhanced DKA prevention plan can reduce the risk of DKA associated with the SGLT2i sotagliflozin (SOTA) to very low levels. In the present study, a similar DKA prevention program will be used to carry-out a 3-year trial to test the kidney benefit of SOTA in 150 persons with T1D and moderate to advanced DKD. After a 2-month period, during which diabetes care will be standardized and education on monitoring and minimizing DKA implemented, eligible study subjects will be randomly assigned (50/50) to take one tablet of SOTA (200 mg) or a similarly looking inactive tablet (placebo) every day for 3 years followed by 2-months without treatment. Neither the participants nor the study staff will know whether a person was assigned to taking SOTA or the inactive tablet. Kidney function at the end of the study will be compared between the two treatment groups to see whether SOTA prevented kidney function loss in those treated with this drug as compared to those who took the inactive tablet. The DKA prevention program will include participant education, close follow-up with study staff, continuous glucose monitoring, and systematic ketone body self-monitoring with a meter provided by the study. If successful, this study will provide efficacy and safety data that could be used to seek FDA approval of SOTA for the prevention of kidney function decline in patients with T1D and DKD.",NO,"Diabetic Nephropathies|Kidney Failure, Chronic|Diabetes Mellitus Type 1|Heart Failure",DRUG: Sotagliflozin|DRUG: Placebo,"eGFR at the end of the wash-out period following the treatment period, eGFR at the end of the 8-week drug washout period following the 3-year treatment period, estimated from Central Lab serum creatinine and cystatin C using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and adjusted by its baseline value.

This study will also provide more information on the safety of this type of supplementation during pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does chromium supplementation at various doses in women with gestational diabetes mellitus truly influence their glucido-lipidic metabolism, oxidative/antioxidant balance, and inflammatory state? If so, is it beneficial or detrimental?
* If this supplementation is beneficial, which dose is the most appropriate?
* Do these types of supplementation have any side effects on the health of the mother and fetus? The participants will take chromium supplements for 6 weeks (supplemented groups) while the control participants will not take them (healthy and diabetic control groups).

A critical strategy in the battle against DM is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based intervention that significantly delays or prevents Type 2 diabetes through the promotion of diet change, exercise and modest weight loss. However, weight loss from the DPP among AAs is about half that of White participants, and suboptimal AA attendance is a critical contributor. The investigators propose to conduct a study that will address social determinants (SD) that challenge DPP attendance with underserved African Americans from a safety net hospital. The investigators will examine DPP attendance and weight loss with participants randomized to 3 groups: standard DPP, a culturally-tailored DPP to address acceptability, and a culturally-tailored DPP enhanced to address socioeconomic-related barriers to DPP participation. This novel study is the first to tailor the DPP to address SD cultural and socioeconomic barriers that limit DPP attendance and reduce its effectiveness on outcomes.

People with type 1 diabetes also have increased risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease, and may benefit from SGLT-inhibition. The exact mechanism of how SGLT-inhibition benefits the kidneys are yet unknown. Change in renal hypoxia may be a factor.

Objective: The primary aim of this study is to assess the effects of 12 weeks SGLT-1 and 2 inhibition on renal oxygenation in persons with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Further aims are to study if renal oxygen consumption and response to SGLT-inhibition differs between people of African-Caribbean or Northern European decent.

Additionally effects on left ventricular ejection fraction, kidney function and biomarkers in blood and urine will be explored.

Method: 12 weeks treatment with oral sotagliflozin or matching placebo as intervention. Kidney oxygenation and perfusion parameters and left ventricular ejection fraction will be assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Kidney function and biomarkers will be assessed according to local hospital laboratory guidelines.

Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross over intervention study.

Study population: 69 persons with type 1 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease with albuminuria will be included, 39 at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, 30 at King's College London.

Primary Objective

The primary aim of this proposal is to establish the feasibility and safety of a 24-week combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention among adult survivors with prediabetes (including a 12-week lifestyle alone run-in followed by 12-week combined intervention among survivors remaining prediabetic).

Primary endpoints of this trial will be adherence to 1) daily metformin administration and 2) completion of required core-curriculum of the lifestyle change intervention. Safety will be assessed using the Global Rating of Side Effects Burden

Secondary Objectives

The secondary aim is to assess preliminary evidence for efficacy of the combined metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention on glycemic control and insulin resistance. Glycemic control will be measured by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and insulin resistance measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) and IGF- binding protein 1 (IGF-BP1; a measure of insulin sensitivity strongly correlated with euglycemic insulin clamp testing).

Exploratory Objectives

The current obesity treatment with long term efficacy is the bariatric surgery, however, the operative risk of this procedure is high and the post-operative iotrogeny may be important. Obesity is most often associated to the feeding behavior which depends on hypothalamic integration of peripheral signals such as leptin and glucose. High levels of circulating leptin are detected in obese patients. These elevated leptin levels fail to reduce appetite or increase energy expenditure. The mechanism underlying this non-integration of peripheral signals remains to be identified. The ratio of leptin levels in the cereprospinal fluid (CSF) and in the periphery is drastically decreased in obese patients when compared to lean individuals, therefore a defective transport of circulating leptin into the brain via the CSF is maybe linked to obesity.",NO,"Obesity Without Type 2 Diabetes, With BMI>30",DRUG: Metformin Oral Tablet,"cerebrospinal fluid /plasma leptin ratio, 3 months","cerebrospinal fluid /plasma glucose ratio, at day 0, 3 months|cerebrospinal fluid /plasma glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) ratio, at day 0, 3 months|cerebrospinal fluid /plasma insulin ratio, 3 months|cerebrospinal fluid /plasma ghrelin ratio, at day 0, 3 months|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP), at day 0, 3 months|Plasma levels of Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP), at day 0, 3 months|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), at day 0, 3 months|Plasma levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), at day 0, 3 months|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), at day 0, 3 months|Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), at day 0, 3 months|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of leptin soluble receptor, at day 0, 3 months|Plasma levels of leptin soluble receptor, at day 0, 3 months|Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a measure of the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue, and is commonly clinically calculated using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

NCT04678895,Low-Dose Naltrexone for the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04678895,,RECRUITING,"Diabetes affects more than 30 million people in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity. Over 25% diabetics also suffer from debilitating painful diabetic neuropathy in the lower legs and feet. This pain can be severe, difficult to control, and have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Opioid medications have historically been a mainstay of treatment for this pain, despite the risks. As the death toll from the U.S. opioid epidemic continues to rise, the need for quality alternative non-opioid medications to treat pain becomes more urgent. One of these potential medications is Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN). This drug is reported to work by enhancing the body's natural pain relieving mechanisms and decreases inflammation by targeting specific cells called microglia which have been shown to influence chronic pain. LDN has been shown to be a safe medication with minimal side effects. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in other painful conditions but has never been fully studied for treating painful diabetic neuropathy. The goal of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to determine if LDN is effective for treating the pain caused by diabetic neuropathy. LDN's mechanism of action is well suited to treating painful diabetic neuropathy, and LDN shows significant promise as a safe, non-opioid alternative that can decrease pain and improve quality of life for those suffering from this painful condition.",NO,Painful Diabetic Neuropathy,DRUG: Naltrexone|DRUG: Placebo,"Change in Pain Disability Index, Pain Disability index (PDI) Score measures the degree to which pain interferes with activities.

In addition to evaluating efficacy, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a model for ophthalmologists to prescribe or collaborate with a primary care provider such as an internist/endocrinologist to prescribe and monitor the drug safely. If this study demonstrates that fenofibrate is effective for reducing the onset of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or and the results are adopted by the community of retina specialists, a new strategy to prevent vision threatening complications of diabetes could be widely adopted. Widespread use of an oral agent effective at reducing worsening of DR would decrease the numbers of patients who undergo more invasive and much more expensive treatment for DR and who are consequently at risk for side effects that adversely affect visual function. This study will also assess the relationship of glycemic variability, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring with DR outcomes.

NCT06305416,A Efficacy and Safety Study of Ranibizumab 10mg/ml Injection (Incepta) in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06305416,,RECRUITING,"Macular edema in diabetes, defined as retinal thickening within two disc diameters of the center of the macula, results from retinal microvascular changes that compromise the blood-retinal barrier, causing leakage of plasma constituents into the surrounding retina and consequently retinal edema. Thickening of the basement membrane and reduction in the number of pericytes are believed to lead to increased permeability and incompetence of the retinal vasculature. This compromise of the blood-retinal barrier leads to the leakage of plasma constituents into the surrounding retina with subsequent retinal edema. Hypoxia produced by this mechanism can also stimulate the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases retinal vascular permeability, causes breakdown of the blood-retina barrier and results in retinal edema.

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most common cause of visual reduction in patients with Diabetes Mellitus. The prevalence of DME globally is around 6.8 %. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness worldwide. DME is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that affects the macula, which is located at the center of the retina and responsible for central vision. Bangladesh is the 10th country in the world for the number of adults living with diabetes with some 7.1 million (5.3-12.0). In Bangladesh, it is therefore expected that diabetic secondary complications, like DR, will increase along with the rising trend of diabetes mellitus.

The use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years, millions of patients have been successfully treated with these biological agents. Ranibizumab is one such therapeutic monoclonal antibody for intraocular use. Ranibizumab is a humanized, recombinant, immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody fragment against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and thus prevents choroidal neovascularization. The small size of ranibizumab allows for enhanced diffusion into the retina and choroid.",NO,Diabetic Macular Edema|Diabetic Retinopathy|Macular Edema|Macular Degeneration|Retinal Disease|Retinal Degeneration,DRUG: Ranibizumab 10mg/ml Injection|DRUG: Lucentis,"Changes in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) from Baseline, To determine the changes in the BCVA was assessed using ETDRS charts or Snellen charts from baseline to Week 12, Baseline and Week 12|Changes in Central Subfield Thickness (CST) from Baseline, To determine the changes in central 1mm subfield thickness as measured by OCT and FA from baseline to week 12, Baseline and Week 12","Proportion of patients who lost fewer than 15 letters (approximately 3 lines) from baseline visual acuity, The VA will be assessed using ETDRS charts or Snellen charts., Baseline and Week 12|Proportion of patients who gained ≥15 letters (approximately 3 lines) from baseline visual acuity, The VA will be assessed using ETDRS charts or Snellen charts., Baseline and Week 12|Evaluation and comparison of safety between reference vs. test drug., Incidence of drug related adverse events as assessed by clinical and ophthalmic examination, vitals and laboratory parameters in both treatment arms, Baseline and upto Week 12",,Incepta Pharmaceuticals Ltd,"Institute for Developing Science and Health Initiatives, Bangladesh",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,70,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2023/CT/01,2024-03-30,2025-07,2025-09,2024-03-12,,2025-03-06,"Bangladesh Eye Hospital & Institute, Dhaka, 1209, Bangladesh",

Approximately 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are overweight or obese. Weight loss benefits several aspects of DM2, such as improved glycemic control, increased insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting insulin. This results in a reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Interventions for weight loss in patients with DM2 include diet, exercise, but also pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. Current standard pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with DM2 in the Netherlands starts with metformin, followed by insulin. Bariatric surgery is indicated at a BMI \> 35 kg/m², in combination with other comorbidities. It is associated with better glycemic control and more weight reduction, compared to intensive medical treatment alone. For patients with not adequately controlled DM2 who are not eligible for surgery (i.e., BMI of \< 35 kg/m²), there is currently a therapeutic gap, which could be filled by one of the currently available endoscopic therapies aiming to reduce weight. One of these therapies is endoscopic suture gastroplasty, performed with the endomina device (EndoTools Therapeutics S.A.).

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic sutured gastroplasty with the endomina device (EndoTools Therapeutics S.A.) for glycemic control, in obese patients (BMI of 30-40 kg/m²) with DM2 under insulin therapy with or without hypertension.

Study design: Prospective interventional study Study population: All consecutive patients, with a BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m² with DM2 for less than 10 years, treated with insulin therapy.

Intervention: Endoscopic suture gastroplasty will be performed using the endomina device.

Main study parameters/endpoints: Reduction of 0.7% in HbA1C after 1 year post procedure.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients will undergo endoscopic suture gastroplasty using endomina, which is known with only minor adverse events (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting), and a serious adverse events so far of \> 1% (one readmission, no surgical intervention needed, no mortality). Afterwards, patients will be followed at 14 days, 1 month, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after gastroplasty for clinical and adverse event assessment.

However, PA levels are often low in individuals with overweight/obesity, and primary care providers (PCPs) are tasked with addressing this issue. The investigative team developed and successfully piloted integrating a Fitbit program into clinical care, where patients were referred by PCPs, and PCPs could view PA data in the Epic electronic health record. Though feasible, PCPs wanted additional support for PA management. The investigative team proposes a reimbursable service of a health coach to work collaboratively with PCPs, to deliver a Fitbit-supported PA program to patients with overweight/obesity who have been prescribed a weight loss medication for weight loss for a minimum of 3 months. In Aim 1, the team will enroll PCPs to refer patients to a 12-week health coaching program.

The reasons for this are incompletely understood. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart that play a role in regulating the metabolic health of an individual. Low circulating level of NPs is an important contributor to increased risk for diabetes. The NP levels are relatively lower among Black individuals thus affecting their metabolic health and putting them at a higher risk for diabetes. This study aims to test the hypothesis that by augmenting NP levels using sacubitril/valsartan, among Black Individuals one can improve their metabolic health (as measured by insulin sensitivity \&

The third group will wear a ""smart"" boot, which will interact with the person through a smart watch and smart phone, and give them direct feedback about how they are doing with following their boot wearing prescription.

The investigators will also be looking at how much physical activity, like walking, the participants do.

It occurs in 15% of all patients with diabetes and precedes 84% of all lower leg amputations. Despite many therapeutic advances over the past decades, including dressings (hydrocolloids, alginate, skin substitutes) and growth factors, healing rates of DFU remain low.

Mechanisms of faulty wound healing in diabetic patients are complex, related to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The main reasons for impaired healing appears to be: 1/exhaustion of local cell populations that promote wound healing; 2/excessive production of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) coupled with reduced expression of the tissue inhibitors of MMPs; 3/impaired neovascularisation coupled with reduced numbers of endothelial progenitor cells and impairment of their functioning. These imbalances may result in excessive degradation of extracellular matrix components, as well as an inappropriate local inflammatory response .

Adipose-derived stroma vascular fraction provides a rich and easily accessible source of autologous cells for regenerative medicine applications. Il contains multipotent stem cells and progenitors called adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) able to stimulate wound healing. There are attracted to the wound site where they supplement the wound bed with similar cell types, secrete numerous growth factors and cytokines, increase macrophage recruitment, enhance granulation tissue, and improve vascularisation . The reparative capabilities coupled with good safety of ADRCs have been illustrated in a study for treating severe and irreversible radiation-induced lesions, and in a study for treating sclerodactyly in patients with diffuse scleroderma. Numerous case reports showing healing of refractory wounds following treatment with autologous ADRCs have also been reported.

Based on these previous reports, the present study aims to assess the efficacy and tolerance of injection of ADRCs for the local treatment of neuropathic or neuro-ischemic DFU.",NO,Diabetic Foot Ulcer,DRUG: adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs),"Percentage of patients achieving 100% wound closure, 20 WEEKS","time to reach complete wound closure, 20 WEEKS|wound surface regression in relative value, 20 weeks|wound surface regression in absolute value, 20 weeks|percentage of patients achieving 50 % wound closure, 20 weeks|ulcer recurrence rate, 20 weeks|change in quality of life assessed by the SF-36 QoL survey from baseline, 20weeks",,Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Marseille,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,45,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2016-41,2023-06,2026-09,2026-12,2016-08-15,,2023-04-21,"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France",

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells.

DR is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a sight-threatening disease characterized in the early stages by neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina, and later by neovascularization that leads to further deterioration of functional vision. Despite the availability of current treatments, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, those between the ages of 20 and 74. Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden.

NCT05914857,Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Pre-diabetic Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05914857,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Pre-diabetes is a state characterized by subclinical impairment in glycemic variables that is intermediate between normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and diabetes. There are two frequently used definitions for pre-diabetes, one from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and another from the World Health Organization (WHO), and both include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and a calibrated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of between 5.7 and 6.4%. More than 30 % of the global population demonstrated one or more forms of prediabetic dysglycaemia. In general, approximately 70 % of individuals with IFG and/or IGT can expect to go on to develop clinical type 2 diabetes at some time in the future, and the risk increases with higher HbA1c levels and with higher BMI. Worse still, the prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide, with a growing number of patients progressing to diabetes. Identification and treatment of pre-diabetic individuals is therefore crucial. Recent evidence suggested that preventing progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes is possible, and thus efficacious interventions for pre-diabetic individuals are the cornerstone of diabetes prevention.

The current paradigm for diabetes prevention in high-risk individuals focuses on achieving moderate weight loss via dietary change and increasing physical activity. However, lifestyle-based weight-loss strategies may initially be successful, but difficult to achieve or maintain.

In many cases, pharmacologic treatments may be needed to regulate blood glucose. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have verified the efficacy of metformin in preventing insulin resistance syndrome, along with the progression of microvascular diseases and heart attacks. Meanwhile, clinical experience and trial data have yielded almost no significant safety concerns for metformin. Nonetheless, it may cause discomfort for up to 25% of patients who experience diarrhea and nausea subsequent to its administration. For patients with a contraindication or intolerable adverse effects to metformin, Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors with novel mode of action may be another alternative.

Large clinical trials have not yet identified a substantial elevation in the frequency of adverse reactions related to SGLT-2 inhibitors when compared to the placebo group. Inhibition of SGLT-2 has some extra advantages for diabetes management over other therapeutic approaches. Firstly, the SGLT-2 is exclusively expressed in renal proximal tubules, and thus selective inhibitors will exert a glucose-lowering effect, independently of insulin secretion. Therefore, SGLT-2 inhibitors can cause weight loss without inducing major hypoglycemic events. Secondly, the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors was supported by large clinical trials in the modern context of antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure management, which may match many of the advantages of metformin. Thirdly, SGLT-2 inhibitors have also been proven to prevent nephropathy for its restriction on albuminuria and inflammatory processes, and to subsequently dampen the deterioration in renal function. Overall, SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated safety in non-diabetic patients, particularly in those afflicted with heart or kidney failure, and have shown to provide additional benefits.

At present, the overall effectiveness and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in improving metabolism of pre-diabetic patients are still unclear. The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor on pre-diabetic patients.",NO,Prediabetic State|Impaired Fasting Glucose|Impaired Glucose Tolerance,DRUG: Dapagliflozin 10mg Tab|BEHAVIORAL: lifestyle interventions,"2h plasma glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 2h-PG change, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)","Change in HbA1c, fasting serum HbA1c change, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Change in Body Weight, fasting body weight change, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Change in Waist Circumference (WC), Change in Waist Circumference (WC), Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Glycemic control including Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) and Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C), Glycemic control including Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) and Glycosylated, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Plasma lipid fractions including Total Cholesterol Levels (CHOL) and Triglyceride (TRG) Levels, Plasma lipid fractions including Total Cholesterol Levels (CHOL) and Triglyceride, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Liver Enzymes including ALT and AST levels, Liver Enzymes including ALT and AST levels, Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)|Creatinine, calculated eGFR, and Albumin/Creatinine Ratio (ACR), Creatinine, calculated eGFR, and Albumin/Creatinine Ratio (ACR), Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (12 weeks)",,Yangjin,Peking University Third Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,120,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,80497,2023-12-20,2025-06-01,2025-12-01,2023-06-22,,2023-07-25,"Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100191, China",

NCT05659368,Tirzepatide Monotherapy in Patients With Wolfram Syndrome Type 1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05659368,,RECRUITING,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS:OMIM 222300) is a group of inherited disorders that usually appear in childhood and cause diabetes, optic atrophy leading to loss of vision, deafness and often diabetes insipidus. Wolfram syndrome affected no more than 0.2 in 10,000 people in the European Union. There is no cure and no treatment that will arrest or delay the progress of the disease.

The gene responsible for WS1 is WFS1, it encodes for wolframin, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response. Recently, drug repurposing has been hypothesized from others and us as being useful for WS1 therapy. More specifically, GLP-1 receptor agonists were suggested as a promising class of anti- diabetic drugs having the potential to delay or even reverse disease progression based on their ability to reduce elevated ER stress in vitro and in vivo.

The objective of this project is to create a model of precision-medicine oriented Rare Diabetes Clinic, which will be specifically dedicated to the treatment and follow-up of complex patients with Wolfram Syndrome. A team of clinicians and researchers specialized in diabetes and/or optic neuropathy and with experience in the subset of monogenic forms will make available a cohort of subjects with Wolfram Syndrome prospectively followed in an interventional protocol on the use of tirzepatide (a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist). It will be a prospective phase 2, non-randomized, single group assignment, intervention trial to determine the efficacy of tirzepatide (GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist) in increasing endogenous insulin production and correcting glycemic lability in patients with Wolfram syndrome type 1 (WS1).

The expected outcomes of this study are 1) to provide a therapeutic option for a devastating orphan disease; 2) to confirm the efficacy of a repurposed drug able to reduce elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a disease that represents a model of ER disease; 3) to confirm the efficacy of the disease modeling based on iPSC to predict the response to treatment; 4) to develop a disease-specific multidisciplinary follow-up.",NO,Wolfram Syndrome,DRUG: Tirzepatide,"changing in endogenous insulin production, C-peptide response in the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT; change from baseline C-peptide response), [Time Frame: month 6±1, month 12±1]|changing in insulin production, mean change from baseline in stimulated 2 hour plasma C-peptide AUC (from MMTT) maximum stimulated plasma C-peptide: the highest value at any time point during the MMTT, [Time Frame: month 6±1, month 12±1]","glucose variability, change from baseline in average glucose (measured by continuous glucose monitoring), [Time Frame: month 6±1, month 12±1]|glycemic variability, change from baseline in coefficient of glucose variation (measured by continuous glucose monitoring), [Time Frame: month 6±1, month 12±1]|change in time in range, change from baseline in time in range (measured by continuous glucose monitoring), [Time Frame: month 6±1, month 12±1]|change in insulin requirements, change from baseline in mean daily insulin use over the 3 days preceeding the study visits.

It is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest in sex. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3; higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 26, 52 (End of Trial Visit)|Patient-scored Global Impression of Severity scale (PGI-S), Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S).The Patient scored Global Impression - Severity questionnaire assesses patient's impression of disease severity. The PGI-S item asks the respondent to rate the severity of their PMD symptoms at the time of assessment (""Please choose the response that best describes the severity of your Primary Mitochondrial Disease (PMD) symptoms today"") on a 7-point scale scored as: ""none"" (1), ""very mild"" (2), ""mild"" (3), ""moderate"" (4), ""moderately severe"" (5), ""severe"", (6), or ""extremely severe"" (7). Higher scores indicate a higher level of severity., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 (End of Trial Visit)|Clinician-scored Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S). The Clinician scored Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The CGI-S asks the clinician one question: ""Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how ill is the patient at this time?"" which is rated on the following seven-point scale: ""normal, not at all ill"" (1), ""borderline"" (2), ""mild"" (3), ""moderate"" (4), or ""marked"" (5), ""severe"" (6), and ""among the most extremely affected patients"" (7). This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behaviour, and function at the time of the assessment.Higher scores indicate a higher level of severity., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 (End of Trial Visit)","Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS), Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Scale for Adults (NMDAS). The NMDAS is a semi-quantitative clinical rating scale designed specifically for all forms of mitochondrial disease. The rating scale encompasses all aspects of mitochondrial disease by exploring several domains: current function, system specific involvement, and current clinical assessment. Each question/item in the NMDAS has a possible score from 0-5. Each of the three section scores are calculated by simply summing the scores obtained for each question in that section, with the higher the score the more severe the disease. Thus, scores can range from 0 to 50 for Sections I and III, and from 0 to 45 for Section II, and from 0 to 145 for Sections I through III. Higher scores indicate a higher level of disease severity., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 26, 52 (End of Trial Visit)|Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF), Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The BPI-SF is a validated (33) self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on the patient's daily functions. BPI-SF evaluates pain severity at its worst, least, and average during the last 24 hours, as well as current pain level, with 0 representing no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable. Seven items measuring interference with daily functioning (general activity, walking, work, mood, relations with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life) are also assessed on an 11-point scale, where 0 represents no interference and 10 complete interferences. The scores can be averaged to the two components of the BPI SF score, the Pain Severity Index and the Pain Interference Index. Higher scores indicate a higher level of severity and impact of pain., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 26, 52 (End of Trial Visit)|Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) Assessments: EQ-5D-5L, Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the EQ-5Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L is a self-report health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument consisting a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system that defines health in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response categories (levels): no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS. The respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 ('the worst health you can imagine') to 100 ('the best health you can imagine'). A higher score denotes a worse health state., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 (End of Trial Visit) and at week 52 (Follow-up)|Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Change from Baseline compared to placebo at week 52 and at other relevant study visits of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The instrument assesses severity of suicidal ideation (""severity subscale""), rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, the intensity of ideation subscale (""intensity subscale""), comprising 5 items, rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation, resulting in 0-25 score range summed from five items, with higher scores indicating more severe suicidal ideation. A score of 0 indicates that no suicide ideation is present. The behaviour subscale is a nominal scale including actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behaviour; and self-injurious behaviour. The lethality subscale assesses actual attempts; actual lethality rated on a 6-point ordinal scale. Higher scores indicate a higher level of severity., Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 26, 52 (End of Trial Visit)|Gastro-Intestinal symptoms., Change from Baseline compared to placebo on the number of gastro-intestinal complaints, intensity and duration. The number of gastro-intestinal complaints/month will be captured, starting at screening until (and including) the week 52 visit.

NCT05017571,Colchicine to Suppress Inflammation and Improve Insulin Resistance in Adults and Adolescents With Obesity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05017571,,RECRUITING,"Background:

About 40 percent of adults and 20 percent of adolescents in the U.S. have a body mass index over 30 kg/m2. Being overweight may lead to a state of low-level inflammation. This may cause health problems. Researchers want to see if an anti-inflammatory medicine can help.

Objective:

To learn if colchicine can improve metabolism in people who have high body weight, increased inflammation, and high insulin in the blood but who have not yet developed high blood sugar.

Eligibility:

People aged 12 and older with high body weight who may have increased inflammation and high insulin in the blood. Healthy adult volunteers are also needed.

Design:

Participants will be screened with the following:

Medical history

Physical exam

Fasting blood tests

Urine tests

Electrocardiogram

Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (They will lie on a table while a camera passes over their body.)

Stool sample and 24-hour food diary (optional)

Participants will have 3 study visits and 3 phone check-ins. At visits, they will repeat some screening tests.

Healthy volunteers will have the baseline visit only. They will not get the study drug.

At the baseline visit, participants will have an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). For this, they will drink a sweet liquid and then give blood samples. They will get a 12-week supply of the study drug or placebo to take daily by mouth.

Participants will have study visits 6 weeks and 12 weeks after they started taking the study drug. At the 12-week visit, they will repeat the OGTT.

Participation will last for 3 (Omega) to 4 months.

One of the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of myocardial infarction among women with HIV may involve reduced ability to increase blood flow through large and small coronary arteries at times when increased flow of oxygen-carrying blood is needed. We are conducting a study randomizing women with HIV and either diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or both to health education alone or to health education plus referral to see either an Endocrinologist or a Nephrologist in a subspecialty clinic for consideration of treatment with medication in a class known as sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors are clinically approved for use in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease but have been shown to be underutilized in people with HIV. One of our key analytic aims will be to test if SGLT2 inhibitor therapy results in improved blood flow through the large and small coronary arteries among women with HIV and either diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or both but who have no history of myocardial infarction. A second aim will be to test if subspecialty clinic referral (with or without SGLT2 inhibitor therapy prescription) results in improved blood flow through the large and small coronary arteries among the same group.",NO,HIV-1-infection|Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction|Metabolic Disease,OTHER: Health Education|OTHER: Subspecialty clinic referral,"Coronary Flow Reserve, Change in coronary flow reserve by cardiac positron emission tomography, 24 weeks|Ectopic Adipose Tissue, Change in ectopic adipose tissue reserve by cardiac computed tomography, 24 weeks","Kidney-related biomarkers, Urine and serum biomarkers related to kidney health and disease, 24 weeks|Metabolic biomarkers, Urine and serum biomarkers relating to metabolism (including glucose and lipid metabolism), 24 weeks|Immune/inflammatory biomarkers, Urine and serum biomarkers relating to inflammation and immune activation, 24 weeks|HIV-specific parameters, Serum variables relating to HIV disease (such as HIV-1 viral load, CD4 T cell count, CD8 T cell count), 24 weeks",,Massachusetts General Hospital,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,80,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,2024P001952|R01HL170905,2025-04,2029-01,2029-06,2025-02-25,,2025-02-25,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States",

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:
