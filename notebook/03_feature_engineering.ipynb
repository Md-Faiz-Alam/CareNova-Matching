      " \"AT-1501 is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that are produced naturally by the subject's immune system to attack and fight foreign substances that cause illness. Monoclonal antibodies are man-made proteins manufactured to serve as substitute antibodies to fight diseases. Monoclonal antibodies can restore, enhance, or mimic (copy) the immune system's attack process; they can also tone down the immune system. AT-1501 is thought to work by dampening down the immune system so that it will be less likely to attack the transplanted cells. For other types of transplants, like kidney, a drug called a calcineurin inhibitor is usually used to prevent rejection. That class of drugs can be toxic to islet cells. AT-1501 is an experimental agent that is anticipated to prevent rejection without harming the islet cells.\"\n",

      " 'Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) is a disease characterised by immune mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Overtime, obvious insulin deficiency develops which requires insulin therapy. T1DM accounts for about 5% to 10% of diabetes cases in Europe and United States. Currently, worldwide incidence is estimated to be around 15 per 100,000 people per year. Despite the advancement that has occurred in the field diabetes therapy, patient with T1DM still suffer from managing their disease as well as continuing to face diabetes related complications. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend a goal of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of \\\\< 7%. However, only 21% of adults in the United States has achieved this recommended goal. Once again, a multinational, multicentre study shows that only 24.3% of participants achieved the glycaemic target of HbA1c less than 7.0 %. Unfortunately, intensifying the insulin therapy in order to reach the targeted HbA1c can result in serious adverse effects of hypoglycaemia and weight gain which is in its turn is known risk factor for cardiovascular disease.'\n",

Currently, many hospitals differ among use of insulin for management of DM in pregnancy, with NPH, glargine and detemir being the most commonly used forms of basal insulin. Outside of pregnancy, NPH is rarely used with glargine and determir being the more common forms of insulin used due to their fewer episodes of hypoglycemia in these patients. Detemir has been well studied in pregnancy and found to be noninferior to NPH. Unfortunately, glargine has not been as well studied in pregnancy. Thus, with this study we want to compare glargine and NPH.\\n\\nThe purpose of this study is to compare two different forms of insulin (Glargine and NPH) that we regularly use to manage diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.'\n",
