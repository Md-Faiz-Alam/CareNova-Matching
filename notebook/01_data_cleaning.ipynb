      "The extent of breast cancer is an important prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with this disease. Therefore, adequate staging at diagnosis is a requisite for optimal treatment. In all patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), distant staging using 18F-FDG PET/CT is recommended. However, the degree of metabolic uptake in the primary breast tumor is significantly lower in the ER+ subtype compared to HER2+ and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). As a consequence, a suboptimal 18F-FDG uptake in ER+ breast cancer patients can potentially lead to missed distant metastases. Fibroblast-activating protein inhibitor (FAPI) is a recently developed radiotracer that binds to FAP, a stromal antigen overexpressed in more than 90% of epithelial-derived tumors and their metastases. Previous studies all show 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT to have a higher detection rate compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT. However, all previous studies were performed without considering breast cancer subtype. If the metabolic uptake by 68Ga-FAPI-46 is higher in ER+ breast cancer patients, more lesions will be detected, resulting in a more appropriate treatment for these patients. Therefore, in this pilot study, the investigators aim to compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG with 68Ga-FAPI-46 as PET-tracer in ER+ breast cancer patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "The evidence-based pharmacologic treatments available for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been established over the last few decades of cardiovascular research. These treatments, termed Foundational Guideline-Directed-Medical Therapies (GDMT), prolong patient life, improve patient-reported symptoms, and reduce hospitalizations for heart failure. A direct effect of most medication classes encompassed within GDMT is the reduction in blood pressure due to their mechanisms of action. In addition, as patients with HFrEF become more advanced in their disease, a significant proportion develop hypotension related to pump failure and autonomic dysfunction, amongst other possible mechanisms. As a result, a significant proportion of HFrEF patients are not optimized on GDMT with hypotension as their limiting barrier that would otherwise have served to improve their heart function, heart failure symptoms, and mortality. Currently, there does not exist any evidence-based strategies to address the problem of hypotension in HFrEF patients who are not optimized on GDMT.\\n\\nMidodrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist (α1-AR) that exerts its effects on peripheral venous and arteriolar vasculature to increase blood pressure. This medication has been used off-label by some clinicians in the hypotensive HFrEF population to increase blood pressure and has been reported to have beneficial effects in improving GDMT utilization as well as increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in published case reports/case series. There does not exist any randomized prospective data on the use of midodrine in the hypotensive HFrEF population. The investigators' objective is to complete the first open-label, randomized control trial of midodrine in the hypotensive HFrEF population to demonstrate feasibility in performing a trial in this patient population and to show efficacy in increasing blood pressure without associated harm. The results of this trial will be used as the foundation and rationale for future studies assessing the impact of midodrine use on GDMT utilization as well as hard cardiovascular outcomes in the hypotensive HFrEF population, including hospitalizations for heart failure and mortality.    1\n",
      "The evidence supporting routine provision of high-dose, high-intensity upper limb neurorehabilitation treatment for stroke survivors beyond the first few months after stroke is limited. The Queen Square Upper Limb (QSUL) programme provides 90 hours of upper limb neurorehabilitation over 3-weeks to chronic stroke survivors. The recently published service evaluation demonstrated encouragingly large, clinically meaningful effects at the level of activity and body function. An alternative way to deliver high doses of effective therapy is through technological developments, e.g. immersive interactive gaming environments such as the MindPod Dolphin programme.\\n\\nThe intention of this study is to provide stronger level evidence for intensive upper limb rehabilitation by conducting a randomised controlled trial of two different types of upper limb training compared to usual care. Patients considered suitable for the QSUL programme will be randomised to either: Group 1- intensive upper limb rehabilitation programme (QSUL); Group 2- MindPod programme; Group 3-wait-list control (who will be offered the treatment after the waiting list is complete).\\n\\nThe first aim of the study is to compare the effect of each type of high-dose, high-intensity upper limb training to usual care using measures of upper limb impairment and activity levels 3 months after treatment is complete.\\n\\nThe secondary aims are to comply with recent recommended by the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable, and (i) investigate the effects of upper limb neurorehabilitation on kinematics of upper limb movement (using a KINARM exoskeleton), and (ii) use neuroimaging (MRI and EEG) and neurophysiological (TMS) measures to determine the characteristics of stroke survivors who are most likely to benefit from this treatment approach.\\n\\nThe results from this work will (i) help determine the impact of two methods of high dose, high intensity upper limb training in chronic stroke patients; (ii) identify whether there are any predictors of treatment response that will help stratify patients in future clinical trials of upper limb neurorehabilitation.                                                                                                                   1\n",
